# University
This contains all of the projects i have made from school assignments. These files are specifically here to show my work to potential employers and possibly learn from the community.

Some assignments/labs may not be completed, i will do my best to note if they are not. As well, il try to add the actual assignment pdf to provide greater contex for some of the questions.

For students attending the University of Manitoba, if you are here seeking help for an assignment in any of the first and second year CompSci courses namely COMP 1010,1020,1240,2150,2160. Please email me instead at zac.kolton@hotmail.com so i can help you through your question. In addition, i would be open to tutoring for students learning java if it is so desired.

Disclaimer: If you found this page, other students can find it to. Im assuming a solution derived from my work will look almost identical to another students'. Hence, i shall not be held responsible for any action that causes you or a fellow student to get into academic trouble with the CompSci Dept.

Thanks
